### üëç Product Recommendations

Automatically recommend products based on the webshop owner\&#039;s selection, increasing the likelihood of cross-selling and upselling opportunities.

Our SparkFP Plugin for WooCommerce lets you add customized Featured Products sections anywhere on your website.

### üé® Customization Options

By default, SparkFP adds Featured Products in the identical style your WooCommerce template offers them, so you don&#039;t need to worry about the looks.

Want to customize the looks of the Featured Products on your website? Just go ahead and do so üòé. No coding skills required.

Did I mention that the products can also be inserted in a carousel (PRO) to become a slider?

### üìç You control the location(s) of the Featured Products

SparkFP offers more than 8 WooCommerce positions to place a Featured Products section, like the Homepage, Product Detail page, Cart page, Checkout page, Products list page and User Account page.

Besides these fixed positions also a shortcode is generated to place the product recommendations on any position you like.

Do you want several sections (PRO) showing your Featured Products throughout your website, perhaps with a different design, number of products, etc? We&#039;ve got you covered as well!

### üì± Responsive Design

The plugin is fully responsive, including the admin area, ensuring a seamless browsing and managing experience across all devices and screen sizes.

### üèÅ Next, Next, Finish

Build up your recommendations with the helpful wizard, which guides you through the process of creating a new product promotion.

### üìà What about analytics?

With SparkFP, you have access to powerful analytics (PRO) that help you understand your customers&#039; preferences and behaviors. This valuable data empowers you to refine your marketing strategies and product recommendations, turning more visitors into satisfied customers and boosting conversion rates.
